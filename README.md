# Dojo Blog App - Created with React

This is React App where users can write blogs. They can further delete the blog if they want.
The landing page shows all the blogs at one place. Once the user clicks on any specific blog, then they are directed to a full detailed blog page.
From there they have an option to delete the blog, or they can go back to home page.
Another option on landing page is to create a new blog, select the author and title, and then publish.
